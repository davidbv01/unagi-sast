# Taint Analysis Implementation

This document explains the taint analysis functionality implemented in the SecurityRuleEngine.

## Overview

The taint analysis system detects security vulnerabilities by tracking data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, checking for proper sanitization along the path.

## Key Components

### 1. Sources
- **Definition**: Points where untrusted data enters the application
- **Examples**: User input, file uploads, network requests, environment variables
- **Detection**: Uses pattern matching against known source patterns in YAML rules

### 2. Sinks
- **Definition**: Points where data could cause security issues if not properly sanitized
- **Examples**: Database queries, file operations, command execution, HTML output
- **Detection**: Uses pattern matching against known sink patterns in YAML rules

### 3. Sanitizers
- **Definition**: Functions or operations that clean/validate data
- **Examples**: Input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries
- **Effectiveness**: Each sanitizer has an effectiveness rating (0.0 to 1.0)

## Analysis Process

### 1. Basic Taint Analysis (`performTaintAnalysis`)

```typescript
// For each source-sink pair:
1. Check if sink occurs after source in code (line-based heuristic)
2. Find sanitizers between source and sink
3. Evaluate sanitization effectiveness
4. Report vulnerability if inadequate sanitization
```

### 2. Enhanced Data Flow Analysis (`analyzeDataFlow`)

```typescript
// More sophisticated tracking:
1. Track variable assignments from sources
2. Monitor sanitization of tracked variables
3. Detect when tracked variables reach sinks
4. Report vulnerabilities in variable flow paths
```

## Vulnerability Detection Logic

### Conditions for Vulnerability
1. **Data Flow Exists**: Source → Sink path detected
2. **Insufficient Sanitization**: No sanitizers OR sanitizer effectiveness < threshold
3. **Timing**: Sink occurs after source (basic heuristic)

### Sanitization Effectiveness Evaluation
- **High Effectiveness**: ≥ 0.8 (considered safe)
- **Medium Effectiveness**: 0.5 - 0.7 (may require multiple sanitizers)
- **Low Effectiveness**: < 0.5 (inadequate protection)

## Example Vulnerability Detection

### Vulnerable Code
```javascript
const userInput = request.body.username;        // SOURCE: Line 1
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userInput + "'";
database.execute(query);                        // SINK: Line 3
```

**Detection Result**: SQL Injection vulnerability (no sanitization between source and sink)

### Safe Code
```javascript
const userInput = request.body.username;        // SOURCE: Line 1
const sanitized = validator.escape(userInput);  // SANITIZER: Line 2 (effectiveness: 0.9)
database.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", [sanitized]); // SINK: Line 3
```

**Detection Result**: No vulnerability (effective sanitization present)

## Configuration

### Source Rules (`sources/user_input.yaml`)
```yaml
rules:
  - id: "user-input-detection"
    type: "user_input"
    severity: "high"
    sources:
      - id: "request-body"
        type: "user_input"
        pattern: "request\\.(body|query|params)"
        description: "User input from HTTP request"
```

### Sink Rules (`sinks/dangerous_operations.yaml`)
```yaml
rules:
  - id: "sql-injection-sinks"
    type: "SQL_INJECTION"
    severity: "high"
    sinks:
      - id: "database-query"
        type: "sql_execution"
        pattern: "\\.(query|execute)\\s*\\("
        description: "Database query execution"
```

### Sanitizer Rules (`sanitizers/input_validation.yaml`)
```yaml
rules:
  - id: "input-sanitizers"
    type: "input_validation"
    severity: "medium"
    sanitizers:
      - id: "validator-escape"
        type: "html_escape"
        pattern: "validator\\.(escape|unescape)"
        description: "HTML entity escaping"
        effectiveness: 0.9
```

## Usage in Extension

### Basic Analysis
```typescript
const engine = new SecurityRuleEngine();
const result = engine.analyzeFile(ast, languageId, filePath, content);

// Check for taint vulnerabilities
const taintVulns = result.vulnerabilities.filter(v => v.rule === 'taint-analysis');
console.log(`Found ${taintVulns.length} taint vulnerabilities`);
```

### Detailed Reporting
```typescript
// Get comprehensive summary
const summary = engine.getTaintAnalysisSummary(result);
console.log(summary);

// Access individual components
console.log(`Sources: ${result.sources.length}`);
console.log(`Sinks: ${result.sinks.length}`);
console.log(`Sanitizers: ${result.sanitizers.length}`);
```

## Console Output

The system provides detailed logging for debugging and monitoring:

```
[DEBUG] 🧬 Starting taint analysis
[DEBUG] 📊 Analyzing 2 sources and 3 sinks
[DEBUG] 🔍 Analyzing source: user_input at line 5
[DEBUG] 🎯 Checking sink: sql_execution at line 10
[DEBUG] 🛤️ Found potential data flow from source (line 5) to sink (line 10)
[DEBUG] ⚠️ VULNERABILITY DETECTED: Unsanitized data flow from user_input to sql_execution

[VULNERABILITY] 🚨 Taint Analysis Vulnerability Detected:
  📁 File: example.js
  📍 Source: user_input (User input from request body) at line 5
  🎯 Sink: sql_execution (SQL query execution) at line 10
  🔒 Sanitizers: None found in path
  ⚡ Vulnerability Type: SQL_INJECTION
  📊 Severity: high
  💡 Recommendation: Add or improve sanitization between source and sink
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Line-based heuristics**: Simple ordering assumption
2. **Single-file analysis**: No cross-file data flow tracking
3. **Basic variable tracking**: Limited scope analysis
4. **Pattern-based detection**: May miss complex patterns

### Planned Improvements
1. **Control flow analysis**: Follow actual execution paths
2. **Inter-procedural analysis**: Track data across function calls
3. **Alias analysis**: Handle variable aliasing and references
4. **Dynamic analysis**: Runtime behavior consideration
5. **Machine learning**: Pattern recognition for unknown vulnerabilities

## Testing

Run the demonstration:
```typescript
import { demonstrateTaintAnalysis } from './test/taint-analysis-demo';
demonstrateTaintAnalysis();
```

This will show how the system detects vulnerabilities in example code and provides detailed analysis output.
